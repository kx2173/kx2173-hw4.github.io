# Brief introduction

<font size="4">I am XU Ke, a year-one graduate studying Biostatistics at [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu). I born in the northeast of China, which is the coldest city in my country.</font> 

This is what my hometown looks like in winter.

I have a pet named Guaiguai. He is so cute and I miss him so much since I came here. Fortunately, my mum sends his photos every single day. Here is Guaiguai.
